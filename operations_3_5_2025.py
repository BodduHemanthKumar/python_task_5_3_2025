# 1.Write a function that takes two numbers as input and performs addition.

# def addition():
#     num1 = int(input("please enter first number: "))
#     num2 = int(input("please enter second number: "))
#     add = num1+num2
#     print(num1," + ",num2," = ",add)
# addition()

# 2.Create a function that accepts a name and displays a personalized greeting.

# def greet():

# 3.Write a function to calculate the square of a given number and show the result.

# def square():
#     number = int(input("please enter a number to find square: "))
#     sq = (number**2)
#     print("square of",number,"is",sq)
# square()

# 4.Write a function to multiply two numbers and display the result.

# def multiplication():
#     num1 = int(input("please enter the first number: "))
